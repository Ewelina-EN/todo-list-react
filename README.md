# Task list

Click on the link to see how it works || https://ewelina-en.github.io/todo-list-react/

Simple task list moved from vanilla JS into React.js The app now doesn't have the functionality added. Soon it will be possible use the buttons to:

- add tasks
- mark tasks as done
- remove tasks from the list
- mark all tasks as done
- hide finished tasks

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Short instruction

For now it is not possible to use the buttons to perform those actions.
1. Type in the task in the input field
2. Click "Dodaj zadanie" button
3. The task will appear in the "Lista zadań" section
4. If task done - click the green checkbox on the left
5. If you want to delete the task, click the red icon on the right
6. After any task is entered into the list, two buttons appear: "Ukryj ukończone" and "Ukończ wszystkie".

    Button "Ukryj ukończone" toggles the status of all finished tasks to hidden. Clicking on it again shows the list.
    Button "Ukończ" sets the status of all tasks to the done. The button is disabled if all tasks are marked as done.
