Simple task list moved from vanilla JS into React.js The app have the functionality like:

- add tasks
- mark tasks as done
- remove tasks from the list
- mark all tasks as done
- hide finished tasks

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Short instruction

1. Type in the task in the input field
2. Click "Dodaj zadanie" button
3. The task will appear in the "Lista zadań" section
4. If task done - click the green checkbox on the left
5. If you want to delete the task, click the red icon on the right
6. After any task is entered into the list, two buttons appear: "Ukryj ukończone" and "Ukończ wszystkie".

    Button "Ukryj ukończone" toggles the status of all finished tasks to hidden. Clicking on it again shows the list.
    Button "Ukończ" sets the status of all tasks to the done. The button is disabled if all tasks are marked as done.
